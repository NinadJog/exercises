# Overview

This repo provides an overview of the various other repos in this account that contain challenge problems and mini-projects. This repo does not contain any code; it contains just documentation and links to the other repos. The other repos contain code in various languages, with a single repo typically containing code from just a single language.

The other repos contain code related to three types of solutions: mini-projects, techniques (how-to's), and challenge problems.

_Mini-Projects_ are just that: small projects that I either did on my own or typed the solution from a book to learn the programming language or its web framework.

The _Techniques_ section contains code for various techniques used in the real world, such as connecting to a database from Haskell, making an HTTP request using Haskell, etc. It's more of a How-To section. It will eventually contain a mixture of code that I wrote on my own and code that I copied from books, although currently it is full of the latter.

The _Challenge Problems_ section contains the most original code -- code I wrote by myself. I have solved some of the challenge problems in more than one language. Solving a challenge problem requires coming up with some kind of an algorithm and implementing it in code.
